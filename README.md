# DioEduzzFirstProject
First Project for Eduzz Bootcamp on Dio.  
The project uses JS, CSS and HTML, and is based on a step-by-step given by the DIO instructor, but with some many modifications. There are a list of the main differences below. The project re-creates the classic Genius game.

### Differences: 

- Made slight change to the directory structure (assets folder holding css, sound files and js files).
- Created an enumarator for color type to manipulate colors on the program.
- Applied a generator function and interators to create a rest between lights and sounds without resorting to async await, rest and promises. 
- Added sound to the game and, a 'start' button and a score screen. 
- Changed the layout a bit (black background with buttons on .8 opacity when inactive, and 1.0 opacity when active, plys a central game penal made as a circular div positioned over the main board div).
- There are other differences in variable names, function structure and general coding, but the results are very similar to those proposed by the project instructor.
